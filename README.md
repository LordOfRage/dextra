## How to build

Simply run the command:
`g++ main.cpp -o main.exe bitstream.cpp draw.cpp pokechar.cpp constants.cpp`

## FAQ (and other complaints)

### Strange characters with strange colouring artefacts appear when I run the command.
This is likely due to the fact that your terminal is not printing the Unicode characters as Unicode characters. To fix this, simply change the character page for your terminal. On Windows CMD, this would be:
`chcp 65001`
If you do not use Windows, please search for your solution online and add an issue on GitHub so I can update the README.

### How to see (insert feature here)?
This project is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions, add an issue.

### Your code sucks.
I know.
